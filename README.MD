# üéÆ 2048 Game Deployment on AWS EKS with Fargate & ALB Ingress

A hands-on DevOps project demonstrating real-world Kubernetes deployment using **Amazon EKS**, **Fargate**, **Helm**, and the **AWS ALB Ingress Controller**. The goal is to deploy a containerized 2048 game application with fully managed infrastructure ‚Äî no EC2 nodes, minimal manual setup, and production-grade networking.

## üìå What This Project Covers

Through this project, I‚Äôve successfully implemented and learned the following DevOps concepts and tools:

### ‚úÖ EKS Cluster Creation Using `eksctl`
- Provisioned an EKS cluster with **Fargate** for serverless pod execution.
- Used `eksctl` for declarative and quick setup of cluster resources (VPC, subnets, etc.).

### ‚úÖ Kubernetes Workload Management
- Defined and deployed:
  - A **Namespace** for isolating the app.
  - A **Deployment** with 5 replicas pulling from a public ECR image.
  - A **NodePort Service** to expose the deployment internally.
  - An **Ingress** resource with ALB annotations to route traffic externally.

### ‚úÖ AWS Fargate for Serverless Kubernetes
- Avoided the complexity of node group management.
- Let AWS Fargate automatically assign compute resources for each pod.

### ‚úÖ ALB Ingress Controller Integration
- Installed the **AWS ALB Ingress Controller** using **Helm**.
- Configured **IAM OIDC Provider** and attached a custom **IAM policy** to the controller‚Äôs service account.
- Used Ingress annotations to create a **public-facing ALB** that routes to the 2048 app.

### ‚úÖ Helm for Kubernetes Add-ons
- Leveraged **Helm** to install and manage the ALB Controller cleanly and efficiently.

### ‚úÖ IAM & Security Configuration
- Created IAM roles and attached policies using AWS CLI.
- Understood how OIDC allows EKS to securely use AWS IAM roles inside pods.
